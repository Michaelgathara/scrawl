# Google Duplex is a technology developed by Google that can carry out natural conversations to perform specific tasks, such as making reservations. While Google Duplex itself is not directly accessible via a public API for general web application development, you can still integrate Google's conversational AI capabilities into your web applications using Dialogflow, which is a platform powered by Google Cloud for building conversational interfaces.
