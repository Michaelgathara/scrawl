Set up a basic Flask application to process requests from Dialogflow.

### app.py
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import dialogflow_v2 as dialogflow

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load your environment variables for Dialogflow
import os
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "path/to/your/dialogflow-key.json"

project_id = 'your-dialogflow-project-id'

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    req = request.get_json(silent=True, force=True)
    action = req.get('queryResult').get('action')
    if action == 'make.reservation':
        return jsonify({'fulfillmentText': 'I can help with that! What date and time would you like to reserve?'})
    return jsonify({'fulfillmentText': 'I did not understand your request.'})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
This basic setup listens for POST requests from Dialogflow, checks the intent action, and provides a response.
