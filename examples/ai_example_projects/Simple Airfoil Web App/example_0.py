### 1. Setting Up a Basic Airfoil Application

First, ensure you've installed Airfoil. You can usually install it via pip:

```bash
pip install airfoil
```

Now, let's create a basic Airfoil application:

```python
from airfoil import Airfoil

app = Airfoil()

@app.route('/')
def home(req, res):
    return "Welcome to the Airfoil web application!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```
