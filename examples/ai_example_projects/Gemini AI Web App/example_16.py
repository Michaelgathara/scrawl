1. **Model Integration**: Integrate a machine learning model using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Train the model separately and load it into the Flask application.

2. **Environment Setup**: Consider Dockerizing the application for easy deployment and scalability.

3. **Security and Optimization**: Implement security practices appropriate for web applications and optimize the model inference time as needed.
